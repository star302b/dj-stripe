                "djstripe",
                ...
            )
        
        Add your stripe keys:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY", "<your publishable key>")
            STRIPE_SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get("STRIPE_SECRET_KEY", "<your secret key>")
        
        Add some payment plans:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            DJSTRIPE_PLANS = {
                "monthly": {
                    "stripe_plan_id": "pro-monthly",
                    "name": "Web App Pro ($24.99/month)",
                    "description": "The monthly subscription plan to WebApp",
                    "price": 2499,  # $24.99
                    "currency": "usd",
                    "interval": "month"
                },
                "yearly": {
                    "stripe_plan_id": "pro-yearly",
                    "name": "Web App Pro ($199/year)",

                    "currency": "usd",
                    "interval": "year"
                }
            }
        
        Add to the urls.py:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            url(r'^payments/', include('djstripe.urls', namespace="djstripe")),
        
        Run the commands::
        
            python manage.py migrate
        
            python manage.py djstripe_init_customers
        
            python manage.py djstripe_init_plans
        
        If you haven't already, add JQuery and the Bootstrap 3.0.0+ JS and CSS to your base template:
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            <!-- Latest compiled and minified CSS -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css">
        
            <!-- Optional theme -->
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap-theme.min.css">
        
            <!-- Latest JQuery (IE9+) -->
            <script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.4.min.js"></script>
        
            <!-- Latest compiled and minified JavaScript -->
            <script src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
        
        Also, if you don't have it already, add a javascript block to your base.html file:
        
        .. code-block:: html
        
            {% block javascript %}{% endblock %}
        
        
        Running the Tests
        ------------------
        
        Assuming the tests are run against PostgreSQL::
        
            createdb djstripe
            pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
            tox

        * https://github.com/agiliq/merchant - A single charge payment processing system that also includes many other Gateways. Really nice but doesn't out-of-the-box handle the use case of subscription payments.
